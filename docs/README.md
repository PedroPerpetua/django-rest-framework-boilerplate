django-rest-framework-boilerplate
===
This repository contains a boilerplate implementation of a Django Rest Framework + Postgres stack, with extended functionality and utilities.

Provided by [PedroPerpetua](https://github.com/PedroPerpetua).


## Version
Currently set up for `python 3.12` with `Django 5.0.6` and `Django Rest Framework 3.15.2`.


## Getting started
After copying this boilerplate, make sure to provide it with it's own `README`, and editing the `pyproject.toml` project name.

Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements/dev.requirements.txt`.

Run `./make.sh test` to ensure everything is working as intended.

Run `./make.sh run` to run the dev server.


## Features

### Project
- Configuration trough environment variables.
- Separated requirement file structure for both production and development.
- Dockerized application, both for development and production environments.
- Separate dockerfile for linting, testing and coverage using `isort`, `black`, `autoflake`, `mypy` and `coverage`.
- CI/CD for linting and testing trough Github Actions.
- Tests for the implemented features.
- A `make.sh` script to support basic operations.

### Django Functionality
- Multiple utility functions and extensions frequently used in Django projects.
- Template app for the `startapp` command that follows the usual restframework patterns.
- Base command to ease command development, with additional `wait_for_db` and `setup` commands.
- Ready to edit custom Admin page.
  - Also features an ordering utility to easily re-order apps and models on the admin page.
- A base for a custom user model with the full JWT authentication flow.
  - This custom user model can be easily setup with mixins to change the username field, set up required email or username, etc.
  - Also includes classes and mixins for views to facilitate working with Users.
  - **NOTE**: The users, by default, have `active=True`. It may be desired to change this behavior.
  - **NOTE**: The simplejwt settings have `UPDATE_LAST_LOGIN: True`. This may hinder performance and may be desired to change this behavior.
  - **NOTE**: By default, registration trough REST endpoints is disabled. This can be changed in the `config.env` file, or directly in the settings (setting `AUTH_USER_REGISTRATION_ENABLED`).

### REST
- A `/ping` endpoint to check server availability.
- Custom error messages using [DRF Standardized Errors](https://github.com/ghazi-git/drf-standardized-errors).
  - A custom `ExceptionHandler` that will automatically convert Django's `ValidationError`s to DRF's `ValidationError`s.
- Out of the box OpenAPI schema with Swagger support using [DRF Spectacular](https://github.com/tfranzel/drf-spectacular)
  - The schema is made available in the `/schema` endpoint.
  - The Swagger view is made available in the `/schema/swagger` endpoint.
  - **NOTE**: By default, only admin users can access these endpoints. This can be changed in the `config.env` file, or directly in the settings(setting `SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS["SERVE_PERMISSIONS"]`).


## Configuration

### Config files
`config.env` is the main configuration file. It's recommended to use `extensions.utilities.env` functions to extract variables in multiple formats from here. See `config.env.example` for available configurations and more details. This file should be placed in the respective docker folders: `./docker/dev/config.env` and / or `./docker/prod/config.env`.

Other project specific settings can be changed in Django's `settings.py` file like a regular Django project, to better suit your needs.


## Requirements
Python requirements can be added on the `requirements` folder. Production requirements go on `requirements.txt` and dev-only requirements go on `dev.requirements.txt`. For production, `pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt` will install all needed dependencies. For development, `pip install -r requirements/dev.requirements.txt` will install all needed dependencies (including the dev ones). The `boilerplate.requirements.txt` and `boilerplate.dev.requirements.txt` contain the base requirements that this boilerplate needs, and are automatically installed with the respective production/development requirements files.


## Make
A convenience `make.sh` script is available for use. Run `make.sh` with no arguments to see all usage options.
