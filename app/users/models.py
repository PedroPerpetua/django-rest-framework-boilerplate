    The concrete user class that will be used in the database.

    By default, implements both a `username` and an `email` field, using the `username` as the model's
    `USERNAME_FIELD`.

    This class can be customized by removing or adding other Mixins. For example, to only have a `username` and no
    email, remove the `UserEmailMixin` from the class' parents. **Every change that modifies the resulting model
    requires a new migration.**

    See the mixins in `abstract_models.py` for more information.
